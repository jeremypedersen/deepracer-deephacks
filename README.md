# DeepRacer "Deep Hacks"

Code taken directly from [this AWS workshop](https://catalog.us-east-1.prod.workshops.aws/workshops/66473261-de66-42a1-b280-3e0ec87aee26/en-US) with minor modifications. **The GitHub repo used in that original labe can be found [here](https://github.com/aws-solutions-library-samples/guidance-for-training-an-aws-deepracer-model-using-amazon-sagemaker).**

## What's it for? 

The code here serves as an example of how you can train DeepRacer models directly using the "underlying services" DeepRacer itself depends on. Namely: 

- [AWS RoboMaker](https://aws.amazon.com/robomaker/)
- [Amazon SageMaker](https://aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/)
